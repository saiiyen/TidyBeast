# TidyBeast Authentication Testing Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ No Supabase Setup Required!

I've created a **simple mock authentication system** that works entirely with local storage. You don't need to learn Supabase or set anything up - it just works!

## ðŸ“‹ How to Test

### Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test User Accounts (Ready to Use!)

#### 1. **Admin Account**
- **Email**: `admin@tidybeast.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Features**: Full admin dashboard access, can see all bookings, revenue charts, user management

#### 2. **Regular Customer Account**
- **Email**: `customer@example.com`
- **Password**: `password`
- **Features**: Customer dashboard, view own bookings, profile management

#### 3. **Create New Account**
- Click "Get Started" and create any new account
- All new accounts are automatically customers
- If you sign up with `admin@tidybeast.com`, you'll get admin privileges
